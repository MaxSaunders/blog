## Background:

The show is an anime called Frieren named after the MC. It follows an elf who was the mage in the party of heroes that defeated the demon king. The exposition shows her old team dying of old age and the main story is her regretting not connecting with them enough, so she is essentially trying to recreate their journey, in an effort to feel closer to them.

The scene in particular follows her and her apprentice visiting a village around 100 years after the defeat of the demon king. Before battling the king they had to face one of his generals. A demon that was too powerful to kill, so instead they were forced to seal him and hope to be able to come back later and take care of him. Now the time on the seal is about to be up and she must go deal with him. For context in this world Demons are creatures of magic, most spend their entire lives devoting themselves to a single art or spell and their identity, and even their rank or nobility is based on their magical skill. This Demon in particular was considered exceptional. He created a killing curse, Zoltrak, a spell that would pierce through defenses, armor and target the person, creating a deadly attack not even these heroes could defend against. The night before Frieren and her apprentice were set to deal with this demon, Frieren imposed upon her apprentice the severity of this fight and the skill and intellect of the demon they were about to face.

## The Scene:

When the two mages arrive at the scene they undo the seal and face their enemy. They greet each other calmly and cordially, as the demon states that he knows time has passed but he is unsure as to how much time. Frieren informs him it’s been over 80 years since their fight and in that time the demon king has been defeated so there is no point in his continued struggle. The demon responds that it would be his honor to avenge his king.

As he prepares his first attack, Frieren instructs her apprentice to prepare a defensive spell, which she does, and once Zoltrak is fired and bounces off of their defense the demon is impressed. Someone finally managed to block his attack. But the apprentice is confused, she turns to her master and asks why he’s only using basic attack magic. Frieren then begins explaining to the demon the toll that time takes. After the defeat of the demon king the humans began researching much of demon magic, namely Zoltrak. They studied it, learned it and used it to develop the modern day basic attack spell, new magic resistant armor and new defensive spells, completely redefining the base level of mage for the next generation.

As Frieren explains this you can tell she is hoping to dissuade the demon from continuing the battle. The demon starts to contemplate this development as you see him cast a smaller version of the defensive spell he just saw for the first time. He begins scratching his chin and analyzing it. He notes how interesting it is that it attunes to the spell and dissipates the magic. He then proclaims that it must use alot of mana, as an enormous grin forms on his face.

Fireren gets back into battle stance as she tells her student to prepare as he discovered the weakness of defensive magic. The demon then, almost as if he is conducting an orchestra, begins a barrage of Zoltrak attacks. The apprentice uses the rest of her strength and skill to defend against the attack as her master lands a single blow of enhanced Zoltrak to kill the demon as his last words were “My spell…”.

What I love about it:

-   The roller coaster of “this demon is a genius” is my favorite part of this scene. He is introduced as a genius mage that will be a major threat. After meeting him and blocking his attack, you begin to think he is outdated, but that is quickly turned on you again as he is able to adapt to the situation and maintain his threat level in the fight.
-   Also, the fact that he was able to see the new spell, cast it immediately and determine its weakness all in the matter of moments, just cements his level of aptitude
-   The passage of time actually feels like a participant in this fight.
-   This shows the power and adaptability of humans in fantasy stories, they are able to grow at a much faster rate than other races through effort and collaboration
-   While this does emphasize the power of time and shows you that even a powerful mage cannot beat the passage of time, it also really displays a recurring theme of this show. The struggle between hard work and talent. The demon was a genius and was able to adapt in the situation on a moment's notice, he still lost to the mage who put in the effort. (But to be fair she had the time to)
-   The line: “Your magic was too strong”
-   The respect shown in this scene between foe’s is interesting. Even though they are trying to kill each other, they let each other speak and converse fairly cordially
-   The show has alot of themes about geniuses vs hard work
-   In this scene, Frieren is the hard worker and the demon is the genius
-   Frieren’s master was a genius and they imply her apprentice is one too
