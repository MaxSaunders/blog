Hello My Name is Max Saunders. Welcome to my blog.

I am a web application developer and a wannabee movie critic. My preferred stack is MERN. And my preferred movie is anything with Nick Cage.
This blog is a fun side project I am doing to refine some skills in React and web deployment as well as store my thoughts on the field of software development and my favorite moments from movies.
